# Advent of Code 2025

This year I explored Elixir early in the year and Common Lisp later in the year. 
My loose goal was to answer all puzzles using Common Lisp while looking for any BEAM/OTP opportunity (highly concurrent processing) that would warrant an Elixir run. 
Alas, it was mostly Common Lisp.

I say that with a little regret: Elixir was a refreshing pleasure when twice I pulled it out. 
With neither fluency in the language nor familiarity with any helpful libraries, Common Lisp was challenging -- maybe more so than Haskell last year.

The event was only 12 Days this year. A hiccup on Day 9 or 10 combined with some family activities put me behind. 
Completed the work on 15 December.

FWIW, the commaraderie and approach sharing on Reddit is wonderful, but the _technical_ moderation is a real bucket of cold water. 
Next year, maybe I'll skip it.
